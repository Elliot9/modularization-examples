However, it can require a lot of work and energy to barely move the needle if it’s truly an area we’re weak in. Obviously, you still want to make sure you don’t have any truly bad areas, but assuming you’ve gotten that, instead focus on amplifying your strengths. How can you turn something you’re good at into your superpower?

6.29 【今日阅读】http://suckless.org/philosophy/ Most hackers actually don't care much about code quality. Thus, if they get something working which seems to solve a problem, they stick with it. If this kind of software development is applied to the same source code throughout its entire life-cycle, we're left with large amounts of code, a totally screwed code structure, and a flawed system design. This is because of a lack of conceptual clarity and integrity in the development process.

2.28 【今日阅读】https://alan-lang.org/the-turing-completeness-problem.html The "business logic" should not be written in Turing complete languages, but rather composable languages based on simple type theory. So the "business logic" would be limited in what it can do to compromise the system. And then it should be deployed on the execution platform, which is a different concern altogether.

1. Traditional engineering is best done in a Waterfall style, while software is best done in an Agile one.
2. Trad engineering is very predictable, while software is very unpredictable.
3. Engineering is mostly about manufacture, while code is mostly about design, because “the code is the design”.
4. Trad engineering is much more rigorous than software engineering is.
5. Software moves much faster than traditional engineering does.

Despite Mr. Martin's obvious passion for the topic, Clean Architecture is poorly organized, lacks examples, and is silent on working with existing systems. The author missed a major opportunity to teach us when and how to apply these lessons to our own systems. Let me explain.
