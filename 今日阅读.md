It flies in the face of prevailing management theory that companies should be reorganized into divisions and business units as they become large. But something vital gets lost in a shift to business units: the alignment of decision rights with expertise.

2.28 【今日阅读】https://alan-lang.org/the-turing-completeness-problem.html The "business logic" should not be written in Turing complete languages, but rather composable languages based on simple type theory. So the "business logic" would be limited in what it can do to compromise the system. And then it should be deployed on the execution platform, which is a different concern altogether.

1. Traditional engineering is best done in a Waterfall style, while software is best done in an Agile one.
2. Trad engineering is very predictable, while software is very unpredictable.
3. Engineering is mostly about manufacture, while code is mostly about design, because “the code is the design”.
4. Trad engineering is much more rigorous than software engineering is.
5. Software moves much faster than traditional engineering does.

Despite Mr. Martin's obvious passion for the topic, Clean Architecture is poorly organized, lacks examples, and is silent on working with existing systems. The author missed a major opportunity to teach us when and how to apply these lessons to our own systems. Let me explain.
