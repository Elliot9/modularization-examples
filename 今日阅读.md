2.28 【今日阅读】https://alan-lang.org/the-turing-completeness-problem.html The "business logic" should not be written in Turing complete languages, but rather composable languages based on simple type theory. So the "business logic" would be limited in what it can do to compromise the system. And then it should be deployed on the execution platform, which is a different concern altogether.

Here you'll find all of those and more. Published first in 1984, it could be among the timeless classics of computer books, such as Fred Brooks' The Mythical Man-Month and Donald Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming.

1. Traditional engineering is best done in a Waterfall style, while software is best done in an Agile one.
2. Trad engineering is very predictable, while software is very unpredictable.
3. Engineering is mostly about manufacture, while code is mostly about design, because “the code is the design”.
4. Trad engineering is much more rigorous than software engineering is.
5. Software moves much faster than traditional engineering does.

1.20 【今日阅读】https://dev.to/bosepchuk/why-i-cant-recommend-clean-architecture-by-robert-c-martin-ofd Clean Architecture failed to meet my expectations on a number of fronts. Despite Mr. Martin's obvious passion for the topic, Clean Architecture is poorly organized, lacks examples, and is silent on working with existing systems. The author missed a major opportunity to teach us when and how to apply these lessons to our own systems. Let me explain.
